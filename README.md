# portfolio_website
Created  html and css for a portfolio webpage.
Css was aided by W3schools [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp)
Over all the project was challenging but fun and will be on going.

## Overveiw:

* header made with the aid of [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_hero_image.asp) for the hero image
* links in nav bar were made with the aid of [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47960948/link-grow-font-on-hover) to grow links for visability
* had to run with trial and error with the linear-gradient when root colors would not work and discovered that rgb was appropriate
* the image flip with in projects was seen before and wanted it for more flair it was implemented with the aid of [W3scools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_image.asp)
* styling images were both provided by [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
